# Slither Configuration Notes

This configuration excludes the following detectors:

## Security-Related Exclusions

### encode-packed-collision
All usages of `abi.encodePacked` have been reviewed and verified to use only fixed-length types (address, uint256, bytes32), preventing hash collision attacks.

### reentrancy-eth
All ETH transfers are protected by the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard:
- `SimpleMultiSig.sol`: executeTransaction()
- `TEEKeyRegistry.sol`: executeProposal(), cancelProposal()

## Other Exclusions

Standard Slither detectors excluded for this project based on design decisions and code review.
