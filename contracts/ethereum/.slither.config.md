# Slither Configuration Notes

This configuration excludes the following detectors and categories:

## Global Exclusions

### exclude_informational: true
All informational-level detectors (2-x series) are excluded as they do not represent security vulnerabilities. These include:
- `timestamp` (2-1): Timestamp usage in blockchain context
- `return-bomb` (2-1): Large return values from external calls

These findings are informational only and do not pose security risks in our implementation.

## Security-Related Exclusions

### encode-packed-collision
All usages of `abi.encodePacked` have been reviewed and verified to use only fixed-length types (address, uint256, bytes32), preventing hash collision attacks.

### reentrancy-eth
All ETH transfers are protected by the `nonReentrant` modifier from OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard:
- `SimpleMultiSig.sol`: executeTransaction()
- `TEEKeyRegistry.sol`: executeProposal(), cancelProposal()

### reentrancy-unlimited-gas
All external calls using unlimited gas have been reviewed and are protected by access controls and reentrancy guards.

## Optimization-Related Exclusions

The following optimization detectors are excluded as they are not security issues:

### immutable-states
State variables that could be immutable are excluded for design flexibility and future upgradability.

### constable-states
State variables that could be constant are excluded for the same reason as immutable-states.

### cache-array-length
Array length caching optimizations are excluded as gas savings are minimal in our use cases.

### unused-state
Unused state variables are intentionally kept for interface compatibility and future use.

## Other Exclusions

Standard Slither detectors excluded for this project based on design decisions and code review:
- `timestamp`: Timestamp usage is acceptable for our use cases
- `naming-convention`: Project follows its own naming conventions
- `assembly`: Assembly usage is necessary for certain optimizations
- `low-level-calls`: Low-level calls are reviewed and necessary
- `costly-loop`: Accepted design trade-off
- `cyclomatic-complexity`: Complexity is managed and reviewed
