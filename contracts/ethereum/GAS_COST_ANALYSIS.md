## Gas Cost Comparison

### 1. Agent Registration Costs

| Version | Configuration | Gas Used | vs V2 | Notes |
|---------|--------------|----------|-------|-------|
| **V2** | Single ECDSA key | 734,225 | baseline | Enhanced public key validation |
| **V4** | Single ECDSA key | 907,385 | +23.6% | Multi-key infrastructure overhead |
| **V4** | ECDSA + Ed25519 | 1,099,963 | +49.8% | Two keys registered simultaneously |

**Key Observations:**
1. **V4 single-key overhead**: The ~173,160 gas increase (23.6%) is due to:
   - Dynamic key array storage vs. single key field
   - Key hash mapping infrastructure
   - Enhanced key type validation
   - Support for future multi-key operations

2. **Incremental key cost**: Adding a second Ed25519 key costs ~192,578 gas
   - This is more efficient than separate `addKey()` transactions
   - One-time registration with multiple keys is recommended

3. **V2 efficiency**: Still the most gas-efficient for single-key agents
   - Recommended for simple use cases
   - No multi-key support trade-off

### 2. Operation Cost Breakdown

#### V4 Multi-Key Operations

| Operation | Estimated Gas | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `registerAgent` (1 key) | 907,385 | Initial registration with single ECDSA key |
| `registerAgent` (2 keys) | 1,099,963 | Registration with ECDSA + Ed25519 |
| `addKey` | ~250,000-300,000* | Add additional key to existing agent |
| `revokeKey` | ~50,000-80,000* | Remove key from agent |
| `approveEd25519Key` | ~45,000-60,000* | Owner approves Ed25519 key |
| `updateAgent` | ~100,000-150,000* | Update metadata and endpoint |
| `deactivateAgent` | ~35,000-50,000* | Deactivate agent |

\* Estimated based on storage operations and contract complexity. Actual costs may vary based on storage state.

### 3. Cost per Key Type

Based on V4 multi-key registration data:

| Key Type | Incremental Cost | Verification Method | Verified On-Chain |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **ECDSA (secp256k1)** | ~907,385 (first key) | Signature recovery | ✓ Yes |
| **Ed25519** | ~192,578 (additional) | Owner approval | ⊘ No (requires approval) |
| **X25519** | ~180,000-200,000* | None (key agreement) | N/A |

\* X25519 estimated based on similar storage requirements to Ed25519

**Key Type Analysis:**
1. **ECDSA**: Most expensive but automatically verified via signature recovery
2. **Ed25519**: Lower gas cost but requires separate owner approval transaction
3. **X25519**: Lowest cost (no verification needed, key agreement only)

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Scenario 1: Single-Key Agent

**Best Choice: V2 (734,225 gas)**
- Savings: 173,160 gas vs V4 (~19% reduction)
- Trade-off: No multi-key support
- Use case: Simple agents, cost-sensitive deployments

### Scenario 2: Multi-Key Agent (2-3 keys)

**Best Choice: V4 with simultaneous registration (1,099,963 gas for 2 keys)**
- Alternative: V2 + 2× `addKey` = ~734,225 + 2×250,000 = ~1,234,225 gas
- Savings: ~134,262 gas (~11% reduction)
- Benefit: All keys registered atomically

### Scenario 3: Multi-Key Agent (4+ keys)

**Best Choice: V4 with simultaneous registration**
- Linear cost increase: ~192,578 gas per additional key
- 4 keys estimated: 1,099,963 + 2×192,578 = ~1,485,119 gas
- Much more efficient than multiple `addKey` transactions

### Scenario 4: Key Rotation/Management

**Best Choice: V4**
- Supports multiple verified keys simultaneously
- Key rotation without downtime
- Gradual migration between key types

## Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Optimizations (Low Effort, High Impact)

1. **Use batch registration for multi-key agents**
   ```solidity
   // ✓ GOOD: Register all keys at once
   registerAgent(params_with_3_keys)  // ~1,485,119 gas

   // ✗ BAD: Register then add keys
   registerAgent(params_with_1_key)   // ~907,385 gas
   addKey(key2)                       // ~250,000 gas
   addKey(key3)                       // ~250,000 gas
   // Total: ~1,407,385 gas + more transactions
   ```

2. **Choose appropriate contract version**
   - V2 for single-key agents (saves ~173,160 gas)
   - V4 for multi-key agents (enables efficient key management)

3. **Optimize key order**
   - Register ECDSA key first (auto-verified)
   - Add Ed25519/X25519 keys in same transaction
   - Reduces approval transaction overhead

### Medium-Term Optimizations (Moderate Effort)

1. **Implement packed storage for keys**
   - Current: Each key uses multiple storage slots
   - Proposed: Pack key type + verification status into single slot
   - Estimated savings: 20,000-30,000 gas per key

2. **Use calldata instead of memory for large arrays**
   - Already using `calldata` for key arrays ✓
   - Verify all public functions use `calldata` where possible

3. **Optimize event emissions**
   - Consolidate related events
   - Use indexed parameters strategically
   - Estimated savings: 5,000-10,000 gas per operation

### Long-Term Optimizations (High Effort)

1. **Implement EIP-1167 Minimal Proxy for agent data**
   - Deploy agent data as minimal proxy contracts
   - Registry stores only proxy addresses
   - Potential savings: 40-60% on multi-key registration
   - Trade-off: Added complexity, separate deployment step

2. **Use storage proofs for key verification (Advanced)**
   - Verify Ed25519 signatures off-chain
   - Submit storage proofs on-chain
   - Potential savings: 50-70% on key addition
   - Trade-off: Requires ZK-SNARK infrastructure

3. **Layer 2 deployment**
   - Deploy on Optimism/Arbitrum for ~10-100× gas savings
   - Maintain Ethereum mainnet for high-security agents
   - Hybrid approach: L2 for operations, L1 for critical agents

## Gas Cost Projections

### Current ETH Gas Prices (as of Q4 2024)

Assuming:
- ETH price: $2,000
- Gas price (base): 30 gwei
- Gas price (peak): 100 gwei

| Operation | Gas | Cost (30 gwei) | Cost (100 gwei) | Cost (USD @ 30 gwei) |
|-----------|-----|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| V2 Register (1 key) | 734,225 | 0.022 ETH | 0.073 ETH | $44.05 |
| V4 Register (1 key) | 907,385 | 0.027 ETH | 0.091 ETH | $54.44 |
| V4 Register (2 keys) | 1,099,963 | 0.033 ETH | 0.110 ETH | $66.00 |
| V4 Add Key | ~250,000 | 0.0075 ETH | 0.025 ETH | $15.00 |
| V4 Approve Ed25519 | ~50,000 | 0.0015 ETH | 0.005 ETH | $3.00 |

**Cost Analysis:**
- **V4 overhead cost**: ~$10.39 at 30 gwei (acceptable for multi-key benefits)
- **Multi-key value**: Registering 2 keys saves ~$15-18 vs separate transactions
- **Peak hours impact**: 3.33× cost increase during network congestion

### Layer 2 Projections

Estimated costs on L2 solutions (Optimism/Arbitrum):

| Operation | L1 Gas | L2 Cost (est) | Savings |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| V4 Register (1 key) | 907,385 | ~0.00091 ETH | ~97% |
| V4 Register (2 keys) | 1,099,963 | ~0.00110 ETH | ~97% |
| V4 Add Key | 250,000 | ~0.00025 ETH | ~97% |

**L2 Benefits:**
- **97% cost reduction** compared to L1
- Same security guarantees (depends on L2 type)
- Faster finality (1-2 seconds vs 12 seconds)
- Trade-off: Bridge costs for L1↔L2 transfers

## Security vs. Gas Trade-offs

### 1. ECDSA Signature Verification

**Current Implementation:**
```solidity
// Verifies signature on-chain (expensive but secure)
address recovered = ECDSA.recover(messageHash, signature);
require(recovered == expectedSigner, "Invalid signature");
```

**Gas Cost:** ~6,000-8,000 gas per verification

**Trade-off:**
- ✓ Immediate verification
- ✓ No off-chain dependencies
- ✗ Higher gas cost
- ✗ Unable to batch verify

**Alternative:** Off-chain verification + Merkle proof
- Savings: ~4,000 gas per signature
- Trade-off: Adds complexity, delayed verification

### 2. Ed25519 Owner Approval

**Current Implementation:**
```solidity
// Owner manually approves Ed25519 keys
function approveEd25519Key(bytes32 keyHash) external onlyOwner
```

**Gas Cost:** ~45,000-60,000 gas per approval

**Rationale:**
- Ed25519 signature verification not natively supported in EVM
- On-chain verification would cost ~300,000+ gas (precompile needed)
- Owner approval provides security with reasonable cost

**Future Improvement:** If EIP-665 (Ed25519 precompile) is adopted:
- Direct verification: ~50,000 gas
- Removes approval step
- Improves UX significantly

### 3. Multi-Key Storage

**Current Implementation:**
```solidity
bytes32[] public keyHashes;  // Dynamic array
mapping(bytes32 => AgentKey) public keys;  // Hash-based lookup
```

**Gas Cost:** ~20,000 gas per SSTORE (new key)

**Trade-off:**
- ✓ Flexible key management
- ✓ Efficient lookup by hash
- ✗ Higher storage costs vs fixed-size array
- ✗ Gas cost increases with key count

**Alternative:** Fixed-size array (max 10 keys)
- Savings: ~5,000 gas per key (slight improvement)
- Trade-off: Less flexibility, wasted storage for agents with few keys

## Comparison with Industry Standards

### DID Registry Implementations

| Protocol | Registration Gas | Key Management | Multi-Key Support |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **SAGE V4** | 907,385 (1 key) | ✓ Add/Revoke | ✓ Yes (up to 10) |
| **SAGE V2** | 734,225 | ✓ Limited | ✗ No |
| **ethr-did-registry** | ~580,000 | ✓ Add/Revoke | ✓ Yes (unlimited) |
| **uPort** | ~650,000 | ✓ Add only | ✓ Yes (limited) |
| **Ceramic Network** | N/A (off-chain) | ✓ CRDT-based | ✓ Yes (off-chain) |

**SAGE Position:**
- **Mid-range cost**: More expensive than minimal implementations
- **Rich feature set**: Multi-key, key approval, hooks
- **Good value**: Comprehensive functionality justifies overhead
- **Ethereum-focused**: Optimized for L1 security model

### Agent Framework Comparison

| Framework | On-Chain Cost | Key Model | Flexibility |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **SAGE** | Medium-High | Multi-key w/ types | High |
| **AutoGPT** | N/A (off-chain) | API keys | Very High |
| **LangChain** | N/A (off-chain) | Configurable | Very High |
| **Fetch.ai** | Low (Cosmos) | Single key | Medium |

**SAGE Differentiator:**
- Only framework with on-chain multi-key DID registry
- Ethereum compatibility (largest DeFi ecosystem)
- Crypto-agile design (supports key algorithm migration)

## Benchmarking Methodology

### Test Configuration

```javascript
// Hardhat Network Settings
{
  chainId: 31337,
  hardfork: "shanghai",
  blockGasLimit: 30_000_000,
  gasPrice: 0,  // No gas price in local testing
  initialBaseFeePerGas: 0
}

// Compiler Settings
{
  version: "0.8.19",
  settings: {
    optimizer: {
      enabled: true,
      runs: 200
    },
    viaIR: true  // Intermediate representation for better optimization
  }
}
```

### Test Scenarios

All tests use realistic data:
- DID: `did:sage:test:0x<address>`
- Name: "Test AI Agent"
- Description: "A multi-chain AI agent"
- Endpoint: `https://agent.example.com`
- Capabilities: JSON with A2A Agent Card format

### Gas Measurement

```javascript
// Actual measurement from tests
const tx = await contract.registerAgent(params);
const receipt = await tx.wait();
console.log(`Gas used: ${receipt.gasUsed.toString()}`);
```

**Accuracy:**
- ✓ Includes all storage operations
- ✓ Includes event emissions
- ✓ Includes signature verification
- ✗ Does not include L1 data costs for L2 deployments
- ✗ Does not include EIP-4844 blob costs

## Recommendations by Use Case

### For Individual AI Agents

**Recommendation:** Use V4 with 2-3 keys (ECDSA + Ed25519 + X25519)

**Rationale:**
- Future-proof key rotation capability
- Support for different crypto operations (signing + encryption)
- One-time cost ~$66 at 30 gwei (acceptable for professional agent)

**Configuration:**
```javascript
registerAgent({
  keyTypes: [KeyType.ECDSA, KeyType.Ed25519, KeyType.X25519],
  keyData: [ecdsaKey, ed25519Key, x25519Key],
  signatures: [ecdsaSig, ed25519Sig, "0x"]  // X25519 doesn't need sig
})
// Cost: ~1,300,000 gas (~$78 at 30 gwei, $2000/ETH)
```

### For Agent Platforms/DAOs

**Recommendation:** Use V4 with L2 deployment

**Rationale:**
- Registering many agents (100s-1000s)
- 97% cost savings on L2
- Can bridge critical agents to L1 if needed

**Cost Example:**
- 1,000 agents × $66 (L1) = $66,000
- 1,000 agents × $2 (L2) = $2,000
- **Savings: $64,000**

### For Enterprise Deployments

**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach (L1 + L2)

**Rationale:**
- Critical agents on L1 (security priority)
- Operational agents on L2 (cost priority)
- Cross-layer communication via bridges

**Configuration:**
- L1: High-value agents, audit/compliance agents
- L2: Development agents, testing agents, internal tools

### For Research/Development

**Recommendation:** Use V2 on testnet, migrate to V4 when multi-key needed

**Rationale:**
- Minimize initial costs
- Simple migration path
- Test V2→V4 upgrade process
