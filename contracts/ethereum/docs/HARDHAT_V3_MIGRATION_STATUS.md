# Hardhat v3 Migration Status Report

## Date: 2024-12-27

## Current Situation

The migration to Hardhat v3 has encountered significant compatibility issues with the plugin ecosystem.

### Work Completed

1. ✅ Created feature branch: `feature/hardhat-v3-migration`
2. ✅ Backed up configuration files
3. ✅ Added `"type": "module"` to package.json
4. ✅ Converted hardhat.config.js to ESM format
5. ✅ Updated Hardhat to v3.0.6

### Issues Encountered

#### Critical Blocker: Plugin Incompatibility

The main issue is that many essential Hardhat plugins have not been fully updated for Hardhat v3 compatibility:

1. **@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers**: Version 3.1.0 is incompatible with Hardhat v3
   - Error: `Class extends value undefined is not a constructor or null`
   - Version 4.0.1 exists but requires other plugins to be updated

2. **Plugin Version Conflicts**:
   - hardhat-chai-matchers requires hardhat-ethers v3
   - hardhat-toolbox v6.1.0 still has peer dependencies on Hardhat v2
   - hardhat-gas-reporter requires Hardhat v2
   - solidity-coverage requires Hardhat v2

### Security Analysis

**Current State (Hardhat v2.26.3)**:
- 0 HIGH severity vulnerabilities
- 13 LOW severity vulnerabilities (all in development dependencies)

**After Migration Attempt (Hardhat v3.0.6)**:
- 0 vulnerabilities detected
- BUT: Project is non-functional due to plugin issues

### Recommendation

**POSTPONE THE MIGRATION**

Reasons:
1. The Hardhat v3 ecosystem is not mature enough
2. Critical plugins are not yet compatible
3. Current security posture is acceptable (no HIGH severity issues)
4. The LOW severity vulnerabilities are only in dev dependencies

### Alternative Approach

Instead of a full migration, consider these interim measures:

1. **Keep Hardhat v2.26.3** for now
2. **Monitor Plugin Updates**: Wait for the ecosystem to catch up
3. **Periodic Security Audits**: Run `npm audit` regularly
4. **Selective Updates**: Update individual packages when v3-compatible versions are available

### Migration Timeline

Estimated timeline for ecosystem readiness:
- Q1 2025: Plugin authors release v3-compatible versions
- Q2 2025: Stable ecosystem with most plugins updated
- Q3 2025: Safe to migrate production projects

### Rollback Plan

To rollback to stable Hardhat v2:

```bash
# Switch back to dev branch
git checkout dev

# Or if you want to keep the work done
git checkout feature/hardhat-v3-migration
cp contracts/ethereum/hardhat.config.js.backup contracts/ethereum/hardhat.config.js
cp contracts/ethereum/package.json.backup contracts/ethereum/package.json
npm install --prefix contracts/ethereum
```

### Next Steps

1. **Document the attempt** for future reference
2. **Set a reminder** to revisit in 3 months
3. **Monitor** Hardhat plugin repositories for v3 updates
4. **Continue** with current v2 setup which is stable and secure enough

### Lessons Learned

1. Major framework version upgrades require ecosystem-wide support
2. Security vulnerabilities in dev dependencies are lower priority
3. Stability trumps bleeding-edge updates for production projects
4. Always create feature branches and backups before major migrations

## Conclusion

The Hardhat v3 migration should be postponed until the plugin ecosystem matures. The current Hardhat v2.26.3 setup is stable, functional, and has acceptable security posture with only low-severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies.
