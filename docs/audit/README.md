## Quick Start for Auditors

### Step 1: Read Audit Scope
Start with [AUDIT-SCOPE.md](./AUDIT-SCOPE.md) to understand:
- What components are in scope
- What to focus on
- Testing coverage
- Expected deliverables

### Step 2: Review Architecture
Read [ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md](./ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md) to understand:
- How components interact
- Data flow through the system
- Security boundaries
- Cryptographic design

### Step 3: Analyze Security
Study [SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md](./SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md) for:
- Critical security features
- Known attack vectors
- Mitigations in place
- Areas requiring special attention

### Step 4: Review Code
Focus on these critical areas:

**Smart Contracts**:
```
contracts/ethereum/contracts/core/SageRegistryV2.sol
contracts/ethereum/contracts/erc-8004/core/ERC8004ValidationRegistry.sol
contracts/ethereum/contracts/core/SageVerificationHook.sol
```

**Go Backend**:
```
crypto/                 # Key management, blockchain providers
session/                # Session lifecycle, AEAD encryption
handshake/              # Secure session establishment
core/rfc9421/           # HTTP message signatures
hpke/                   # HPKE implementation
```

### Step 5: Run Tests
```bash
# Smart Contract Tests
cd contracts/ethereum
npm test
npm run coverage

# Go Backend Tests
cd ../..
make test
make test-integration
go test -race ./...
```

## Key Security Features to Audit

### 1. Public Key Validation (Smart Contract)
```solidity
// Location: SageRegistryV2.sol::_validatePublicKey()
✓ 5-step validation process
✓ Challenge-response ownership proof
✓ Revocation check
```

**Questions for Auditors**:
- Can validation be bypassed?
- Is ownership proof secure?
- Can revoked keys be re-registered?

### 2. Session Key Derivation (Go)
```go
// Location: session/manager.go::CreateSession()
✓ HPKE key agreement (X25519)
✓ HKDF-based key derivation
✓ Directional keys (client→server, server→client)
```

**Questions for Auditors**:
- Is HKDF usage correct?
- Are ephemeral keys properly deleted?
- Can session keys collide?

### 3. Replay Attack Prevention (Go)
```go
// Location: session/nonce.go
✓ Nonce cache with TTL
✓ Timestamp validation
✓ Thread-safe concurrent access
```

**Questions for Auditors**:
- Is nonce generation secure?
- Can nonce cache overflow?
- Race conditions possible?

### 4. Message Signatures (Go)
```go
// Location: core/rfc9421/verifier.go
✓ RFC 9421 compliant
✓ HMAC-SHA256 signatures
✓ Constant-time comparison
```

**Questions for Auditors**:
- Is canonicalization correct?
- Timing attacks possible?
- Can signatures be forged?

## Critical Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Agent Impersonation
```
Attacker Goal: Send messages as legitimate agent
Required: Agent's private key
Mitigations:
✓ DID-based authentication
✓ On-chain public key verification
✓ Challenge-response ownership proof
```

### Scenario 2: Man-in-the-Middle
```
Attacker Goal: Intercept and modify messages
Required: Network access
Mitigations:
✓ TLS for transport
✓ HPKE for ephemeral keys
✓ Message signatures (HMAC)
✓ DID signatures on handshake
```

### Scenario 3: Replay Attack
```
Attacker Goal: Replay captured messages
Required: Captured message
Mitigations:
✓ Nonce cache
✓ Timestamp validation
✓ Session expiration
```

### Scenario 4: Key Compromise
```
Attacker Goal: Use stolen private key
Required: Access to agent's key storage
Mitigations:
✓ Key revocation mechanism
✓ Session invalidation
✓ New key registration with proof
```
