## Quick Start for Auditors

### Step 1: Read Audit Scope
Start with [AUDIT-SCOPE.md](./AUDIT-SCOPE.md) to understand:
- What components are in scope
- What to focus on
- Testing coverage
- Expected deliverables

### Step 2: Review Architecture
Read [ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md](./ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md) to understand:
- How components interact
- Data flow through the system
- Security boundaries
- Cryptographic design

### Step 3: Analyze Security
Study [SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md](./SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md) for:
- Critical security features
- Known attack vectors
- Mitigations in place
- Areas requiring special attention

### Step 4: Review Code
Focus on these critical areas:

**Smart Contracts**:
```
contracts/ethereum/contracts/core/SageRegistryV2.sol
contracts/ethereum/contracts/erc-8004/core/ERC8004ValidationRegistry.sol
contracts/ethereum/contracts/core/SageVerificationHook.sol
```

**Go Backend**:
```
crypto/                 # Key management, blockchain providers
session/                # Session lifecycle, AEAD encryption
handshake/              # Secure session establishment
core/rfc9421/           # HTTP message signatures
hpke/                   # HPKE implementation
```

### Step 5: Run Tests
```bash
# Smart Contract Tests
cd contracts/ethereum
npm test
npm run coverage

# Go Backend Tests
cd ../..
make test
make test-integration
go test -race ./...
```

## Key Security Features to Audit

This section highlights critical security features. For detailed analysis and code examples, see [SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md](./SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md#1-critical-security-features).

### 1. Public Key Validation (Smart Contract)
- **Location**: `SageRegistryV2.sol::_validatePublicKey()`
- 5-step validation process
- Challenge-response ownership proof
- Revocation check

### 2. Session Key Derivation (Go)
- **Location**: `session/manager.go::EnsureSessionFromExporterWithRole()`
- HPKE key agreement (X25519)
- HKDF-based key derivation
- Directional keys (client→server, server→client)

### 3. Replay Attack Prevention (Go)
- **Location**: `session/nonce.go::Seen()`
- Per-keyid nonce cache with TTL
- Lock-free sync.Map implementation
- Background garbage collection

### 4. Message Signatures (Go)
- **Location**: `core/rfc9421/verifier.go`
- RFC 9421 compliant
- HMAC-SHA256 signatures
- Constant-time comparison

### 5. Vault Encryption (Go)
- **Location**: `crypto/vault/secure_storage.go`
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100K iterations)
- Passphrase-based security

## Critical Attack Scenarios

For detailed attack vectors, mitigations, and threat analysis, see:
- [SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md](./SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md#2-attack-vectors--mitigations)
- [ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md](./ARCHITECTURE-OVERVIEW.md#5-threat-model)

**Key Scenarios**:
1. **Agent Impersonation**: DID-based authentication, on-chain verification
2. **Man-in-the-Middle**: TLS + HPKE + message signatures
3. **Replay Attack**: Nonce cache + timestamp validation
4. **Key Compromise**: Key revocation mechanism
5. **Session Hijacking**: Opaque Key IDs, session expiration
6. **Smart Contract Exploits**: Access control, reentrancy guards
7. **DoS Attacks**: Rate limiting, TTL-based cleanup

## Testing Coverage

### Smart Contracts
```
SageRegistryV2:              95% coverage
ERC8004ValidationRegistry:   92% coverage
SageVerificationHook:        88% coverage
```

### Go Backend
```
crypto/:      93.7% coverage (recently increased)
crypto/keys:  95%+ coverage
crypto/vault: 92% coverage
session/:     85% coverage
handshake/:   82% coverage
core/rfc9421: 88% coverage
hpke/:        90% coverage
```

**Note**: See [AUDIT-SCOPE.md](./AUDIT-SCOPE.md#4-testing-coverage) for detailed test types and methodology.

## Known Issues and Limitations

For complete details, see [SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md](./SECURITY-CONSIDERATIONS.md#3-known-limitations) and [AUDIT-SCOPE.md](./AUDIT-SCOPE.md#5-known-issues--limitations).

**Summary**:
1. **Cross-Platform Builds**: Low severity, build-time only
2. **Nonce Cache Memory**: TTL-based cleanup mitigates DoS risk
3. **Admin Centralization**: Multi-sig and timelock planned
4. **Clock Synchronization**: ±5 minute tolerance for timestamps
