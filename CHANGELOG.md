## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-30

### Summary

Re-added KME (Key Management Extension) public key storage to AgentCardRegistry with enhanced security validation. This release restores the `kmePublicKey` field that was present in v1.3.1 but removed in v1.4.0, now with critical security improvements for HPKE (Hybrid Public Key Encryption) support per RFC 9180.

### Added

#### AgentCardRegistry: Three-Phase Secure Registration System

- **Three-Phase Registration Flow**: Enhanced security via commit-reveal pattern
  - **Phase 1 (Commit)**: Anti-front-running protection with commitment hash and 0.01 ETH stake
  - **Phase 2 (Register)**: Time-windowed reveal (1-60 minutes) to prevent immediate exploitation
  - **Phase 3 (Activate)**: Sybil-resistant activation delay (1+ hour) with stake refund
  - Economic security through stake requirement (refunded upon successful activation)

- **New CLI Commands**:
  - `sage-did commit`: Initialize registration with commitment hash and stake
  - `sage-did register`: Reveal commitment and register agent after delay
  - `sage-did activate`: Activate agent after time-lock period
  - Automatic commitment state management in `~/.sage/commitments/`

- **Enhanced Security Features**:
  - Commitment-based anti-front-running (prevents DID theft attacks)
  - Time-locked activation prevents rapid spam registration
  - Operator delegation system (ERC-721 style approval pattern)
  - Rate limiting: 24 registrations per address per day
  - Hook system for extensible pre/post-registration validation
  - Multi-key support: ECDSA (Ethereum), Ed25519 (Solana), X25519 (HPKE)

- **Smart Contract Infrastructure**:
  - `AgentCardRegistry.sol`: Production registry with commit-reveal pattern
  - `AgentCardStorage.sol`: Isolated storage layer for future upgradability
  - `AgentCardVerifyHook.sol`: External validation and anti-fraud checks
  - Gas-optimized storage patterns with efficient array operations

#### KME (Key Management Extension) Support

**Contract Layer:**
- Added `kmePublicKey` field to `AgentMetadata` struct (32-byte X25519 keys)
- Added `getKMEKey(bytes32 agentId)` view function for O(1) access
- Added `updateKMEKey(bytes32, bytes, bytes)` function with owner-only access
- Added `KMEKeyUpdated` event for key rotation tracking
- Enforced single X25519 key per agent policy

**Go Integration:**
- Added `PublicKEMKey` field to `AgentMetadataV4` struct
- Added `GetKMEKey(ctx, agentID)` client method
- Added `UpdateKMEKey(ctx, agentID, newKey, signature)` client method
- Updated `GetAgent()` to populate `PublicKEMKey` field
- `ResolveKEMKey()` already implemented in DID resolver

**X25519 Ownership Verification:**
- All X25519 keys must be proven owned by registering account
- ECDSA signature verification using ecrecover
- Signature includes chain ID and registry address (replay protection)
- Prevents Sybil attacks and key theft

**HPKE Integration:**
- KEM key resolution via DID
- Integration with HPKE client
- Support for RFC 9180 hybrid encryption
- Seamless integration with existing DID infrastructure

### Changed

#### Breaking Changes

**X25519 Signature Requirement** (HIGH Impact):

All X25519 key registrations now require ECDSA signatures to prevent key theft attacks.

**Before (v1.3.1 and earlier):**
```javascript
const params = {
    keys: [ecdsaKey, ed25519Key, x25519Key],
    keyTypes: [0, 1, 2],
    signatures: [ecdsaSig, ed25519Sig, "0x"]  // Empty X25519 signature
};
```

**After (v1.5.0):**
```javascript
const x25519Sig = await createX25519Signature(signer, x25519Key);
const params = {
    keys: [ecdsaKey, ed25519Key, x25519Key],
    keyTypes: [0, 1, 2],
    signatures: [ecdsaSig, ed25519Sig, x25519Sig]  // Required ECDSA signature
};
```

**Other Breaking Changes:**
- KeyType enum reordered (ECDSA=0, Ed25519=1, X25519=2)
- Registration flow changed from single-phase to three-phase
- New contract addresses required (AgentCardRegistry vs SageRegistryV4)
- See [AgentCardRegistry Migration Guide](docs/AGENTCARD_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details

**Deprecated:**
- SageRegistryV4 single-phase registration (still functional but deprecated)
- Legacy registration CLI commands (replaced by commit/register/activate)
